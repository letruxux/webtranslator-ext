# webtranslator-ext
my first extension!

basically translates current page when you click on the icon. simple right? well, maybe too much, as it may not work. report bugs in issues!
you can fork and make the edits yourself, if you want to and understand the code (easy af)

also i got icon from flaticon, because i'm too lazy to make one myself.
